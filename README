Libraries and hacks for Standard ML

To bootstrap the compiler, use
    mlton aml.sml

To compile the examples, use
    aml example.aml

The compiler accepts mixed source of Standard ML and AML.
    aml example.sml

For now the only difference between the two is the 
    use "another_file.sml"; 
syntax extension.
